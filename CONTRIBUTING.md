# How to contribute
As mentioned in the README, all contributions are welcome! If you want to contribute, try and:

- Have general understanding of .md files  
- Use proper grammar, but don't worry too much about punctuation
- Stick to the general formatting of the README

You might want to look at the formatting yourself, but as a general overview:

<br>

# Heading
Some information about the heading, maybe an introduction would go here. The spacing might look a bit weird on smaller headers, but in my opinion it looks fine on larger ones. The spacing between headers should be as follows:
```
# Heading
Text here

<br>

#Another Heading
More text here
```
**_This also applies to subheadings!!!_**

## Subheading
Normally used to create a new workflow section, an example subheading might be "Encountering an incorrect type"

If you have a workflow that has 3 steps in it, write it like this

**1. Step 1**
> - More steps
> - More steps

**2. Step 2**
> - More steps
> - More steps

### Sub-subheading
Used for smaller topics inside a workflow section, an example sub-subheading might be "Notes"

### Give credit
If you ever take information from a certain website, user, etc., please credit them!

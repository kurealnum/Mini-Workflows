# Personal-Workflows
Just my workflows for software design. I.E., a little algorithm for problems you or I might encounter. Updated as I find better ways to do things. 

# Mindset:

## Introduction/Journaling:
*I'm 16, I'm not a psychologist :>*

All of these workflows are really intended for ***education***, not just for you to code as quickly as possible. That's the secondary goal of course, but if that was truly the primary goal, there would be one section telling you to go straight to ChatGPT.

## Planning

Planning is so incredibly important. The only time I don't completely plan my software out is when it's one file, and ***I know*** that it's shorter than 80-100 lines. 

If you don't plan your work out, it becomes so much more tiring to keep track of your goals, and your current place in those goals. This kinda flows into the next section, Breaks.

## Breaks
Breaks are ***very*** important. Whether you want to be as refined as the Pomodoro technique, or you just take breaks sporadically, like me, breaks are incredibly imporant.

It's also important to remember that your mind works a lot better in the background (i.e., the subconscious), than it does in your “conscious” state. What I’m getting at is, if you’re stuck on something, go stare at something and think about something else. Professional chess players do it, software devs do it, and they do it for a good reason. 

# Encountering bugs/problems: 

## Encountering a bug
### 1. Check the syntax 

### 2. Walk through your logic

#### 2.5. If it's an algorithm:
-Are you considering all possible data structures?

-Could you have multiple options for different cases?

-Did you whiteboard it?

### 3. Reference other code of yours

#### 3.5. Before you google it:
-Should I know this code?

-Should I be able to do this?

-Did I thoroughly complete steps 1-3?

### 4. Google it

#### 4.5. Before you use GPT:
-Have you done everything else you could?

-Are there any other personal methods that I could use?

-Would a person be better suited to this question?

### 5A. Ask a human being:
-There are plenty of amazing online communities that are here to help!

-Places like [TPH (The Programmers Hangout)](https://discord.gg/programming) and language specific communities are frequently found on places like Discord and Reddit

-GPT tends to be better for technicals, but past that, humans will always excel in the artistic design of code

### 5B. Ask GPT
-Make sure you *completely* understand why you couldn't solve the problem

-Practing similar problems isn't a horrible idea, althought it may be incredibly time consuming.

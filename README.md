# Personal-Workflows
Just my workflows for software design. I.E., a little algorithm for problems you or I might encounter. Updated as I find better ways to do things. 

# Mindset:

## Introduction/Journaling:
*I'm 16, I'm not a psychologist :>*

All of these workflows are really intended for ***education***, not just for you to code as quickly as possible. That's the secondary goal of course, but if that was truly the primary goal, there would be one section telling you to go straight to ChatGPT.

## Planning

Planning is so incredibly important. The only time I don't completely plan my software out is when it's one file, and ***I know*** that it's going to be shorter than 80-100 lines. 

If you don't plan your work out, it becomes so much more tiring to keep track of your goals, and your current place in those goals. This kinda flows into the next section, Breaks.

## Breaks
Breaks are ***very*** important. Whether you want to be as refined as the Pomodoro technique, or you just take breaks sporadically, like me, breaks are incredibly imporant.

It's also important to remember that your mind works a lot better in the background (i.e., the subconscious), than it does in your “conscious” state. What I’m getting at is, if you’re stuck on something, go stare at something and think about something else. Professional chess players do it, software devs do it, so it must work, right? 

## Learn by doing, not by looking
I'm a firm believer in this concept, and if you're reading this, it's likely that you are too. You can read documentation all you want, grind out W3 Schools tutorials, but until you sit down and push yourself through something that you didn't do yesterday, you're not really "learning". Even if you're taking notes, or copying the tutorial down into your own editor, I still don't think it equates to actually doing something. Learning is hard, and while repetition can help, actually challenging yourself will really do the trick.

 However, a major problem comes with said concept. That problem being projects; i.e. what projects to do, when, and where. In my opinion (*please remember that I'm 16*), beginners struggle with this the most, because there's no prior experience to help guide you into a new language or framework. However when you take someone who already knows concepts and 1 or 2 languages, the entire dynamic of the whole process changes. You already have a foothold to step on, and leap into that. I think this flows somewhat nicely into my next topic, Tutorial Hell (I'll get to that tomorrow, this might still be here next commit lol)
 

# Encountering bugs/problems: 
My workflows for certain problemms; probably the most useful part of this whole file.

## The Big 2:
The 2 ***REALLY*** important things to do every time you have encounter a bug:

### 1. Check the syntax
This is a crucial part of almost every single one of my workflows, you'll see it mentioned again and again. Even if you're working in an editor with linting/syntax highlighting, still check it. I've missed plenty of important things because I thought that my editor would catch it.

### 2. Walk through your logic
Whiteboarding is amazing here!

## Encountering an incorrect function return

### 1. [The Big 2](#the-big-2)

### 2. Walk through the function by:
-Go past the function you're working in

-Go through every function that is called/used in said function

-Go into documentation if the function is built in

-Figure out what it should be returning, and why

### 3. Minimize
-Take away as many functions as possible, and try and isolate the problem function

### 4. Find context
-Look at some other code that involves this function. What does it do differently/the same?

-If it's your own function, attempt to isolate the sub-function (if you will), and do the same for that function


## Encountering a bug
### 1. [The Big 2](#the-big-2)

#### 1.5. If it's an algorithm:
-Are you considering all possible data structures?

-Could you have multiple options for different cases?

-Did you whiteboard it?

### 2. Reference other code of yours

#### 2.5. Before you google it:
-Should I know this code?

-Should I be able to do this?

-Did I thoroughly complete steps 1-3?

### 3. Google it

#### 3.5. Before you use GPT:
-Have you done everything else you could?

-Are there any other personal methods that I could use?

-Would a person be better suited to this question?

### 4A. Ask a human being:
-There are plenty of amazing online communities that are here to help!

-Places like [TPH (The Programmers Hangout)](https://discord.gg/programming) and language specific communities are frequently found on places like Discord and Reddit

-GPT tends to be better for technicals, but past that, humans will always excel in the artistic design of code

### 4B. Ask GPT (Or a similar tool)
-Make sure you *completely* understand why you couldn't solve the problem

-Practing similar problems isn't a horrible idea, althought it may be incredibly time consuming.

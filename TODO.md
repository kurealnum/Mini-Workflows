# TODO
- Website design workflow?
- Find and contribute more topics!
- Add/update resources for certain topics
- Move some notes from [my notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dsKtlQvBVS0YjssJrlLmZ9SU0yh8zz9m) as workflows/ideas

By the way, the prompt was "How could I phrase "public workflows that everyone can contribute to" in 2 words? Give me a few options".

# User flows
Before you even start desigining your website, you should map out where you want the user to go, from start to finish. It might look something like this: 
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./.github/userflowexample.png"/>
</p>
<br>

While this is a very basic rendition of a user flow, it does give you a good idea of what one might look like. In my opinion, you shouldn't stress over it too much, just make sure it looks generally nice (and complete!).

# TODO
- Website design workflow?
- Find and contribute more topics!
- Change the repo name? I don't particularly like it right now.
- Add/update resources for certain topics
- Move some notes from [my notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dsKtlQvBVS0YjssJrlLmZ9SU0yh8zz9m) as workflows/ideas

### Name Ideas

I asked GPT for some name ideas, and here's what it gave me:
- Open Collaborations
- Crowd Workflows
- Collective Processes
- Community Methods
- Shared Systems
- Group Workflows
- Public Contributions
- Collaborative Paths
- Inclusive Workflows
- Participatory Routines

By the way, the prompt was "How could I phrase "public workflows that everyone can contribute to" in 2 words? Give me a few options".

# TODO

- Find and contribute more topics!
- Move some notes from [my notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dsKtlQvBVS0YjssJrlLmZ9SU0yh8zz9m) as workflows/ideas

Maybe a section on Mobile First websites? I'm not sure how that counts as a "workflow" though.

A "how to speak" section could be cool (mainly because I already have notes on it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLljSGaZh2E2GIvV3WQG86l98pGi0_jWnHtg17Ym6L4/edit#heading=h.y637gxjly1be)), but I don't know if that really fits into the idea of a workflow.

# TODO

- Website design workflow?
- Find and contribute more topics!
- Add/update resources for certain topics
- Move some notes from [my notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dsKtlQvBVS0YjssJrlLmZ9SU0yh8zz9m) as workflows/ideas

## Website design workflow ideas

Just a general outline!

1. User Flows
2. Wireframing
3. Design system
4. Designing
5. Critiquing
6. Testing

Opinions?

I'm working on this in the TODO file because I don't know exactly where I want to put it right now, but I will find a place for it!

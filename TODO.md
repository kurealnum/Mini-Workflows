# TODO
- Website design workflow?
- Find and contribute more topics!
- Add/update resources for certain topics
- Move some notes from [my notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dsKtlQvBVS0YjssJrlLmZ9SU0yh8zz9m) as workflows/ideas

## Website design workflow ideas
Just a general outline!

1. User Flows
2. Wireframing
3. Design system
4. Designing
5. Critiquing 
6. Testing

Opinions?

# User flows
Before you even start desigining your website, you should map out where you want the user to go, from start to finish. It might look something like this: 
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="./.github/userflowexample.drawio.png"/>
</p>
<br>

While this is a very basic rendition of a user flow, it does give you a good idea of what one might look like. In my opinion, you shouldn't stress over it too much, just make sure it looks generally nice (and complete!).

# Wireframing
Now that you have an idea of where you want the pages to go, it's time to start desigining the page! The process will be similar to creating your userflow, except a little bit more in depth. 

When you design your wireframe, focus on creating connected pages, layouts in said pages, and anything else like that! 

In case you're confused, here's a very simple example (referencing our previous image in [user flows](#user-flows)):
